# Social Network

This is a simple social network web application (Facebook clone) I'm building as a personal exercise.

## Technologies used

- Django
- Django REST Framework
- AngularJS
- Bootstrap

## Setup

- Clone the repository
- Install the requirements from `requirements.txt` (recommended in a new virtual environment)
- Create a new Postgres database (should work with MySQL too, haven't tested it though)
- Add the database credentials to the `settings.py` file
- Migrate the database
- Start the server

## Features

- Login/register
- User profile
- Timeline posts
- User search engine

## Tasks I'm currently working on

- Migrating from jQuery to AngularJS
- Clean up the code
- Comments on the timeline posts
- Better search engine using Metaphone for fuzzy-search

## Features for the distant future

- Groups
- Messaging system (Preferably in chat format using websockets)
- Notifications
- Post sharing
